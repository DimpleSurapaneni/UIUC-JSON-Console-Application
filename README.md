# UIUC JSON Console Application

## Project Overview
The **UIUC JSON Console Application** is a C# console application that processes training completion data from a JSON file. This application helps organizations track training completions, identify expired or soon-to-expire trainings, and perform data analysis effectively.

## Features
- **Data Input**: Reads training completion data from a specified JSON file.
- **Task 1**: Counts how many unique individuals completed each training and outputs the result to a JSON file.
- **Task 2**: Lists individuals who completed specified trainings within a defined fiscal year and saves the results to a separate JSON file.
- **Task 3**: Identifies individuals with trainings that have expired or will expire soon, providing detailed status information in an output JSON file.
- **Output Files**: All output files are saved in the same directory as the input JSON file for easy access.
